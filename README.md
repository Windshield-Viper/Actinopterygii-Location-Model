# Actinopterygii-Location-Model
ML model to predict locations of fishes in the class _Actinopterygii_ (ray-finned fishes) found in freshwater systems. This model was made in Google Colab, which is why everything has Google Drive file I/O. To make it, I used _Actinopterygii_ location data from IUCN as well as Pandas and FastAI.
